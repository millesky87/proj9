Contact must be made within (3) days of package receipt in order  to request a return on a non-personalized piece.","policy_additional":"\u2665:{ Turnaround Time for Your Custom Piece }:\u2665\r\nPlease feel free to contact me BEFORE your purchase for current turnaround time. \r\n\r\nI make every effort to create your item within 14 days after payment has cleared. This is the time it takes BEFORE your item is ready to ship. This does not include shipping time over which I have no control. During periods of heavy volume, such as holidays or large storewide sales, this time may be increased. \r\n\r\nPlease remember your custom piece of jewelry is created by hand. I am not a factory nor am I an assembly line. I am only one person (sometimes two as my darling husband handles the shipping!) creating, emailing, packing and shipping orders.  \r\n\r\nI am a only a convo away should you have any questions or concerns!\r\n\r\n\u2665:{ Product Information}:\u2665\r\nAll charm jewelry created by Three Little Pixies is made with the finest metals available. Unless otherwise specified all jewelry items are made with sterling silver, copper or brass. Upon request your item can be made from gold filled discs. Actual 14kt gold is too soft to stamp. In it&#39;s place we use gold filled items. THESE ARE NOT GOLD PLATED. Plating is a process where the base metal is covered with gold or silver to give the look of the real thing but the process will inevitably cause flaking and breakthrough. Filling, on the other hand is an actual layer of gold-pressure bonded to another metal. It contains more gold than gold plated and is much more valuable and tarnish resistant.  Gold filled items will not flake off, rub off or turn colors. Anyone who can wear gold, can wear gold filled without worry of allergic reaction. With proper care it will last as long as 14K gold.\r\n\r\nEach piece is hand stamped by me using individual stamping tools. Every single letter, number or design is stamped by ME one at a time on your piece. Because of this please note that NO two pieces will be exactly the same. Letters, Numbers, Designs, etc.  may not be perfectly straight or aligned and spacing may vary. These should not be looked at as imperfections but  as what makes your piece YOURS ALONE and ONE OF A KIND. \r\n\r\nDarkening may vary depending on the depth of the stamp and may fade over time. This is a natural process when wearing fine metal.\r\n\r\nWe use a petite sterling silver rolo chain when creating our jewelry. Prices include necklaces up to 18&quot;. If you would like a 20&quot; chain for an additional $5 please be sure to leave a note in the message to seller field or contact me for a custom listing. 1 mm sterling silver ball chain is also available as an upgrade. 16&quot; and 18&quot; necklaces are a $15 up charge. Contact me prior to checkout and I&#39;ll adjust the listing for you!\r\n\r\n\u2665:{Warranty Information}:\u2665\r\nAll components of your necklace are under warranty for 45 days from the date of purchase. Should your jump rings loosen or chains break from normal wear and tear during this time frame we will replace them for you free of charge. After that period there will be a minimal fee to replace broken\/loosened components. Pieces sent back for repair will be inspected, polished and all components checked and tightened before being returned. \r\n \r\n\u2665:{Gift Packaging}:\u2665\r\nAll items come boxed and ready for gift giving. If you would like to send it directly to your recipient please by sure to update the address the item is to be sent to when you check out through Paypal. Also, feel free to let me know if you would like me to enclose a gift card! :o)\r\n\r\n\u2665:{Safety Information}:\u2665\r\nPLEASE ALSO NOTE that all jewelry sold by Three Little Pixies Boutique is not intended for children under the age of 12.  When giving our products to young children and toddlers please make sure that they are fully supervised to prevent accidental choking on the small pieces.\r\n\r\n\u2665:{Care of Your Three Little Pixies Jewelry}:\u2665\r\nDue to the metals natural reaction with both the environment and your body oils, it will tarnish over time and require a tiny bit of upkeep. Here are some tips to keep your jewelry looking it&#39;s BEST and BRAND NEW.\r\n\r\n* DO NOT wear when using Body Sprays, Perfumes, Hair Spray or Household Products. Your jewelry should be put on AFTER you&#39;ve applied or come into contact with these items.\r\n\r\n* DO NOT clean silver with cleaning dips, polishes or liquids. This will cause the removal of the darkening in the letters. The best way to care for your piece is to use a piece of polishing cloth and gently rub it to remove the tarnish.\r\n\r\n* If you are not wearing your piece, store it in an air tight container or zip lock bag.\r\n\r\n\u2665:{We LOVE Custom Orders!}:\u2665\r\nFeel free to contact us for wholesale pricing, consignment or quantity discounts.  \r\nxoxo\r\nLiz","policy_seller_info":null,"policy_updated_tsz":1409328115,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/3LittlePixiesShoppe?utm_source=explorer&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/017\/0\/6279136\/iusb_760x100.13204128_rlmm.jpg","num_favorers":3252,"languages":["en-US"]}},{"listing_id":174860941,"state":"active","user_id":18301042,"category_id":69169391,"title":"80&#39;s Sweater XL 80&#39;s Cardigan XL Oversized Sweater Slouchy Sweater Pink Sweater Boyfriend Sweater Large Grandpa Sweater Golf Sweater","description":"Vintage 80&#39;s slouchy sweater.

We are always working for you, both in and out of our studio, so we might not always be available by phone. However, our computers are always close at hand and near to our hearts, so email is the best way to reach us, most of time.\r\n\r\n------------------- \u2022\u2665\u2022-- Production Time--\u2022\u2665\u2022-------------------\r\nOur unique and hand-made products may look magical but they are not made with the wave of a wand, so production times vary depending on the design you choose and the materials you decide to use. General production times can be found on our home page. Please make sure to include ALL of the relevant and important information about your big event upon checkout to avoid delays in delivery.\r\n\r\n------------------- \u2022\u2665\u2022-- Total Cost--\u2022\u2665\u2022-------------------\r\nEverything that we produce for you has a price. It is not always easy to figure out, but a total cost can be determined by multiplying the listing price by the quantity needed. \r\n\r\n------------------- \u2022\u2665\u2022-- Rush Orders --\u2022\u2665\u2022-------------------\r\nWe understand, things happen, so of course, rush services and expedited shipping are available on a case-by-case basis and will be accommodated as our production schedule allows. There will be additional fees added to all rush orders depending on the timeframe required and the size of the order, so we prefer that you give yourself (and us) all the time that is needed for perfection.

There are many things, including size and shape that could affect your shipping rates. We will work with you to ensure you are aware of all shipping costs at the time of your order. Please keep in mind that we cannot be responsible for your packages once they are out of our capable hands. To better ensure your special delivery, signature confirmation and\/or shipping insurance is available upon request.\r\n\r\n------------------- \u2022\u2665\u2022-- Cancellations --\u2022\u2665\u2022-------------------\r\nAll Cancellations must be made within 24 hours of your order being placed for your payment to be refunded.

The best way is to &quot;Follow&quot; me on Etsy or go to my website and sign up for my Newsletter - www.warmkittyquilts.com . \r\n\r\nWe offer only the very best quality quilt and sewing fabric - Windham, Benartex, Art Gallery, Blend, Riley Blake, Quilting Treasures and Moda.  \r\n\r\nWe offer fabric by the fat quarter, half yard or yard, jelly rolls, layer cakes, charm packs, fat quarter bundles and more.\r\n\r\nIf you are a Nancy Halvorsen fan, we have you covered.  We offer many of her fabrics, her patterns, books... We are HUGE Nancy Halvorsen fans!  If you need help selecting fabrics for a particular pattern, just let us know and we can help.\r\n\r\nWe carry the entire line of quilt patterns from CLUCK CLUCK SEW!! - In my opinion, they just don&#39;t get better than this.  Allison Harris&#39;s patterns are modern, fun and fast.  Most of them are perfect for beginners and many use jelly rolls, layer cakes and fat quarters.  If you want help selecting fabric for a pattern, just convo us and we would LOVE it!\r\n\r\nWe also carry other patterns and books.

Once your order gets over 2 1\/2 yards, you can add more yardage until you are up to a total of 9 yards without extra shipping.  Just keep that in mind and save!\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING - you will notice the rates are high... higher than they may need to be.  I do not make money on shipping and only charge the cost of the shipping.   You can convo to ask the exact amount before your order, I am happy to do that for you.  Otherwise, I will refund anything over $1 that is overcharged.  The international rates are very tough to calculate and as you add items, it REALLY gets crazy.  \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please don&#39;t hesitate to ask.
